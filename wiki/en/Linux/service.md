# Services

## Raspberry Pie (and the related products)
<note></note> This is mainly a copy of Johannes Gehrs [post][jg-link] on medium.

###Installation
Install systemd by installing the packages <mark>systemd</mark> and <red-h>systemd-sysv</red-h>:
~~~sh
apt-get install systemd systemd-sysv
~~~

###Checking the Status of Services
Use <ic>systemctl</ic> command without parameters for listing all the running services.
To look at one specific service (for example transmission-daemon) issue 
<ic>systemctl status <red>transmission-daemon</red></ic>.

###Stopping, Starting, Restarting and Reloading Services
For Stopping a service issue <ic>sudo systemctl <red>stop</red> transmission-daemon</ic>.
For Starting it issue <ic>sudo systemctl <red>start</red> transmission-daemon</ic>. To
Restart it issue <ic>sudo systemctl <red>restart</red> transmission-daemon</ic>.
systemd also has a generic way to issue the soft reload that transmission-daemon and 
many other services support: <ic>sudo systemctl <red>reload</red> transmission-daemon</ic>.

###Understanding the Journal
The systemctl commands will not write it to standard output. systemd writes
the output of init scripts and all status messages generated by systemd 
to something called _journal_. You can get the last relevant lines of 
output from the status command, by issuing: 
<ic>systemctl status transmission-daemon</ic> but the status will not show
the log entries unless you run it with root privileges.

So for getting the last log-messages use <ic><red>sudo</red> systemctl status transmission-daemon</ic>
instead. To see the full log issue <ic>sudo journalctl -u transmission-daemon</ic>
 
###Permanently Enabling or Disabling Services

To disable a service issue: <ic>sudo systemctl disable transmission-daemon</ic>. 
Respectively use: <ic>sudo systemctl enable transmission-daemon</ic> to
enable a service.

<note></note> You can still manually start or stop services even if they are 
enabled or disabled. It just means that they wonâ€™t start or stop at boot.

If you actually want to make it impossible that the service is started you can mask it:
~~~bash
systemctl mask transmission-daemon
~~~
Respectively, to unmask you should issue:
~~~bash
systemctl unmask transmission-daemon
~~~
<note></note> Issuing disable, enable; mask or unmask will not start or 
stop the service. You need to do this separately.

###Understanding Service Files
Service files are located in <ic>/lib/systemd/system</ic>
