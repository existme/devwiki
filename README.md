# Readme

This wiki contains information, and cheatsheets about various topics regarding configuration or usage. 
I've put it on github to extend it with help of other people. The main wiki is hosted on a wiki called
[BananaDance](http://bananadance.org/). I removed most parts of BananaDance configuration so the main markdown
files could be used and be hosted elsewhere.

## Issues:
I used some custom markups for codehighlighting within the .md files. Right now I am not aware of a better way
to make it more standard but would be surprisngly glad if somebody could help with that. Such markups are like
<ic>highlightedcode</ic> or <red>red lable</red>.
