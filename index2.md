## Editing this file

<!-- Feature note: {{ currentLanguage }} below is a standard variable. -->

To edit this file, simply open "wiki/{{ currentLanguage }}/index.md" and make your desired changes.
You can use full [markdown extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/).


## Creating More Pages

Simply create a new ".md" file in the "wiki/{{ currentLanguage }}" folder.

### Example

Perhaps you want to create documentation for the "Installation" process of your program? Simply 
create a file named "wiki/{{ currentLanguage }}/Installation.md". The program will automatically detect it are display 
it in your primary navigation.


## Creating More Categories

<!-- Feature note: "?l=sub_category_sample" below references a named route. -->

Notice how there is an "Example_Subcategory" folder in the "wiki/{{ currentLanguage }}" folder. Also notice how the 
navigation on the left shows a sub-category named "Example_Subcategory", as well as the "[Sample](?l=subcategory_example)" 
file within that directory.

That is how you create categories: you a folder anywhere in the "wiki/{{ currentLanguage }}" folder.
